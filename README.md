# Chronostories

## Description
Thanks to Chronostories, writing books has never been easier! 
Organize your mind, set a good plot, define your characters and start writing!

But what is Chronostories? It's mainly a tool, based on the concept that there's only one thing that all the books in the world have in common: they start at the first page and end on the last one.
Perhaps the book has a linear plot, perhaps it hasn't, but it doesn't matter. There will always be a linear timeline *outside* the book, while the reader flips from one page to another.

How will this tool help you? Simply providing a way to link you ideas, your drafts and your structure with a "timeline". 

But the idea is *waaay* bigger than that. 

What you will find today is the basic tool, what the two of us created in 48h while fighting against time, sleep deprivation, work emergencies (yes, of course, thank you Murphy's Law) with the help of thousands of coffees and, *ehm*, superalcoholics.

What you will see tomorrow (not literally, really, I need some sleep before that) are the following incredible features:
- Tags! Everyone loves tags, and you will be able to follow your characters around the book and the places they visited. You will be able to link them to any block, and use them to filter, sort and keep tracks of their thread inside the weaving of your story
- Different timelines! Why a book should be linear if it can be not? You will be able to define the book time-sequence and the story time-sequence, and reorder the blocks as you like
- Hashing terms! You will be able to link any word, tag or text block to a special window, outside the written story, where you can add your notes and thoughts, and every time the word/tag will be used again, you will see the link to the note
- Fork! You like the book that guy is writing on Chronostories but you don't like the last chapter? Fork it and change it! Life is too short to read badly written endings
- Sharing! Because we are lazy, and what's better than someone else that will finish the book you started five years ago and since then it has been a constant item in your New Year's Resolutions List?
- Schemes! You think you have the magic formula for a book? Write a scheme and help everyone that want to start that kind of book giving him/her a rough structure to begin with
- Templates! Right now you can export your book, but it's a pdf with a simple style on it. Perhaps you want a different structure, color, font or spacing. Perhaps you want it in lit, mobi or epub? Yeah, we can do that
- Comments on someone else's story! Add sticky notes with your witty comments on someone else's work. Remember, everyone loves when you point at their wrong their/they're
- Agile! An amazing way to define your tasks and stories, and perhaps we will put also some Gantt plot! Because we want developers and managers to be able to write a book
- Like/Unlike! You facebook addicted will like it
- Follow your favourite authors! Perhaps they will notice your amazing story, you'll get published, become rich, you'll write a book on how to become rich with Chronostories and we'll become rich as well!
